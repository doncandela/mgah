## Introduction <a id="intro"></a>

### What is this?<a id="whatis"></a>

This is an elementary introduction to Git and GitHub, with an emphasis on the concepts that I found confusing when I first learned about these things -- these are the explanations I wish I had when I was getting started.
The goal is simply to get started using these things; more detailed and advanced documentation is abundantly available elsewhere.

Unlike many intros to Git+GitHub, this tutorial **goes as far as possible without making use of CLI** (command line interpreter), which is only discussed in the (long) last section.
Here is [another, more fully developed tutorial](https://jcszamosi.github.io/mcmaster_swc_git_gui/08-conflict/) I have found on **using Git+Github graphically** -- includes screenshots, diagrams, etc., unlike this document.
