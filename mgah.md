## Introduction <a id="intro"></a>

### What is this?<a id="what-is"></a>

This the cheat sheet I that accumulated as I learned to combine several tools for **parallel computing in Python** on various **Linux** computer systems:

- **MPI** allows multiple instances of Python to operate in parallel and communicate with each other, in the cores of a single computer or a cluster of connected computers. Code written to parallelize using MPI can utilize all the cores of a desktop computer and also scale to a larger number of cores in an HPC computer cluster.

- A **GPU** installed in a single computer can carry out highly parallel computations, so it offers an alternative to "MPI on a cluster of computers"" for parallelizing code - but the degree of parallel operation is limited by the model of GPU that is available (unless multiple GPUs and/or GPUs on multiple MPI-connected computers are used, things not discussed in this document).

- **Apptainer** is a **container** system that allows user code and most of its dependencies (OS version, packages like NumPy) to be packaged together into a single large "image" file, which should then be usable  without modification or detailed environment configuration on many different computer systems from a Linux PC to a large cluster.

- High-performance Computing (**HPC**) typically refers to using a large cluster of connected computers assembled and maintained by Universities and other organizations for the use of their communities.  This document only discusses an HPC cluster running Linux and managed by  **Slurm** scheduling software, with  the the **UMass Unity cluster** as the specific HPC system described here.

Why Python?  Why Linux? Because those are what I use, and this is my cheat sheet.

Although there may be some information useful for the following topics, this document **does not cover:**

- Other than brief mentions, the use of OpenMP (a multithreading package not to be confused with OpenMPI) and/or the Python Mutiproccessing package for parallelization on the cores of a single computer.

- Operating systems other than Linux (Windows, macOS...).

- Computer languages other than Python such as C++.

- Direct, low-level programming of GPUs in CUDA-C++  (as opposed to the use of GPU-aware Python packages like CuPy and PyTorch, which are briefly covered).

- "Higher level" (than MPI) packages for using computer clusters such as Spark, Dask, Charm4Py/Charm++...).

- Cloud computing (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure...). 

- The Docker container system, other than as a source for building Apptainer containers.

- The Kubernetes scheduling/management software typically used rather than Slurm in commercial settings, particularly with Docker.

### Parallel computing in Python<a id="parcomp-python"></a>

Python is a semi-interpreted language (compiled to a byte code, like Java) and so is much more slowly executed than a fully compiled language like C++, unless an add-on like [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/) is used (neither of these is discussed further in this document, although they may certainly be useful).

Therefore good performance on large tasks is often achieved by using **packages** (typically written by others in a compiled language like C++) like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), to carry out the time-consuming **inner loops** of algorithms. The same is true of other high-level languages like [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/).   While some think Python is inherently slower than C++, if the time limiting factor is, for example, a large linear algebra operation then in either language it will likely be carried out by the same highly-optimized [BLAS](https://www.netlib.org/blas/) function on a CPU (via NumPy, for Python), or the corresponding [cuBLAS](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas) function on a GPU (via CuPy).

There are however some murky intermediate situations. For example [Numpy advanced indexing](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html) allows many complicated operations (e.g. operations on elements meeting complicated conditions) on arrays to be carried out much faster than if they were coded directly in Python -- but maybe slower than would be possible in C++.

Be that as it may, the premise of this document is **speeding up Python code** by using one or the other of the following strategies (or potentially both together, although that is not discussed in detail):

(a)  **by running many copies of the same Python code at the same time** on the multiple cores of one or more CPUs, or

(b) **by using a GPU** which is a highly-parallel computational device which however does not directly run Python code (or C++ code, for that matter, although a specialized hybrid language called [CUDA C++](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/) is often used to program GPUs).

For case (a) the individual, simultaneously-executing copies of a Python program can each take advantage of packages like Numpy and SciPy, providing parallel speedup in addition to that provided by such packages. Conversely for case (b) packages like Numpy and SciPy are **replaced** by GPU-aware packages like CuPy and PyTorch.

it is important to distinguish between **multithreading** and **multiprocessing**:

- A **process** is an independently-running program with its own memory space and other resources. Each process can run an independent Python program. Each core of a CPU can run multiple processes, but only one at a time (i.e. serially) - running multiple processes in parallel requires multiple cores.

- A **thread** is part of a process, that can sometimes use multiple cores to run in parallel with other threads in the same process. For example BLAS which is called by Numpy to do linear algebra can use **multithreading** to run faster if multiple cores are available to the process.

- Although a Python program can call packages like Numpy/BLAS that are sped up by doing multithreading on multiple cores, only one Python interpreter at a time can run in a process (for now - there is a [proposal](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/) to relax this). Thus to carry out parallel *Python* operations **multiprocessing** is required. This can take several different forms:
  
  - Python has a standard package [**`multiprocessing`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) that can run parallel processes on the different cores of a single CPU (maybe on all the cores in the typically two CPUs in an HPC node? Iâ€™m a bit unclear on this).
  
  - The C++ package [**OpenMP**](https://www.openmp.org/) (Python bindings [**PyOMP**](https://github.com/Python-for-HPC/PyOMP)) can also run parallel processes on the different cores single CPU (or single node = typically two CPUs?).
  
  - [**MPI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) can run parallel processes on the different cores of a single CPU and **also on multiple nodes connected by a network**. Implementations of MPI go under names like [**OpenMPI**](https://www.open-mpi.org/) (not to be confused with the non-MPI single-node multiprocessing package OpenMP) and [**MPICH**](https://www.mpich.org/).
    
    - Rather than directly use MPI, various higher-level applications like [**Spark**](https://spark.apache.org/), [**Dask**](https://www.dask.org/), or [**Charm4py**](https://charm4py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (perhaps no longer supported) can be used to coordinate parallel operations between cores and nodes. These applications can use MPI, and do not require MPI coding by the user. 
  
  - Parallel Python processes that do not need to communicate at all can be run on separate nodes of an HPC cluster as separately launched jobs, without using any of the things mentioned above.

- I havenâ€™t used either of the Python packages `multiproccessing`, PyOMP but I believe the `multiprocessing` package has more high-level language support for Python. I believe this type of single-CPU, multi-core multiprocessing should be possible in an Apptainer container as described in this document, but I havenâ€™t tried this.

Finally, some Python jargon: A text file with extension `.py` containing Python language statements is sometimes called

- a **program**, considering it to express an algorithm like a C++ program, or
- a **script**, considering it to be a set of high-level directives, or
- a **module**, considering it to be code that could be imported into another `.py` file.
  In this document these three terms are used interchangeably with apologies to those who make distinctions between them.

### MPI on a Linux PC<a id="mpi-pc"></a>

#### Why do it<a id="why-mpi-pc"></a>

Using MPI, multiple copies of a Python program can run in parallel on the cores of a PC, but the same thing can be accomplished with the [Python `multiprocessing` package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html), probably more easily (I haven't tried `multiproccesing`).

What MPI can do (and `multiprocessing` cannot do) is increase the parallelism to copies of Python running on **multiple computers connected by a network** - i.e. multiple nodes of an HPC cluster. Therefore a possible reason for developing MPI-parallel code on a PC is to enable eventual expansion to a higher degree of parallelism on an HPC cluster.

Note, however, that parallelism across all the cores of any single node of an HPC cluster could be accomplished without MPI by using the `multprocessing` package.  (Unity nodes currently have up to 128 cores.)

**TODO** here and in the HPC sections: When does an MPI program that uses eg Numpy multithread?  How can this be controlled?

### Using an NVIDIA GPU on a Linux PC<a id="gpu-pc"></a>

#### Why do it<a id="why-gpu-pc"></a>

A relatively inexpensive GPU can offer significant speedups. For example in [test results](#gpu-list) on a PC assembled in 2022 the \$300 GPU was about four times faster than the \$550 16-core CPU chip for operations on large dense and sparse matrices.

If the code might eventually be transferred to an HPC cluster, the more capable GPUs on the HPC nodes should offer greater speed-ups than this.

### Using Apptainer on a Linux PC<a id="apptainer-pc"></a>

#### Why do it<a id="why-apptainer-pc"></a>

Code that is containerized using Apptainer should be usable on various PCs without setting up environments with the correct packages (with compatible versions) installed.  However, this does require Apptainer itself to be installed on the PCs, which is not necessarily trivial or commonly done.

Probably the best reason for containerizing code is to make it easy to run the code on an HPC cluster, which is likely to have Apptainer pre-installed and ready to use (as Unity does).  In the examples below, containers developed and usable on a PC were also usable without modification on Unity.

## Part 2: Moving code to a Slurm HPC cluster<a id="move-to-hpc"></a>

#### Why do it<a id="why-hpc"></a>

In general one uses an HPC cluster to get more computational power (e.g. if doing simulations carry out bigger and/or more simulations) than might be otherwise possible, due to one or more of the following factors:

- For code can only run on one computer but can use multiple cores, an HPC cluster typically will have computers with high core count (up to 128 cores per node on Unity).
- For code that can use MPI to run on more than one networked computer, an HPC cluster can offer even larger core counts since by a cluster consists of many computers networked together.
- For code that can use a GPU to speed up computations, an HPC cluster may include higher-performance models of GPU than otherwise available.
- For code that requires a lot of memory, HPC clusters are typically configured with considerable memory.
- Even if none of the situations above is true, multiple jobs can be run simultaneously on an HPC cluster.

However, the individual CPUs in an HPC cluster are typically no faster than those in a desktop PC (sometimes slower, as HPC computers are optimized for reliability) -- so there may be little advantage to running code that is not parallelized with either MPI or utilization of a GPU on an HPC cluster, apart from the higher core count of individual computers and the possibility of running multiple jobs simultaneously.

Finally, the computational resources of an HPC cluster are only useful if available within reasonably short times waiting in queue. Jobs requiring many computers or the fastest GPUs may sit a long time before starting.
